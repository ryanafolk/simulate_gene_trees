# simulate_gene_trees

Simulate gene trees given a newick species tree with branch lengths in coalescent units. The script takes three arguments: an input file name, a desired number of trees, and an output name. This script requires Dendropy and is based on supplemental methods from Mirarab et al. 2014 in Science: [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1250463.figures-only]
